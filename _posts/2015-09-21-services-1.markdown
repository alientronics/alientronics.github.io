  We developed a hardware that sticks the inside of the tire can precisely monitor the pressure and temperature. 
  The sensor is completely sealed without suffering damage from liquids, dust or vibration, and the duration of 8 years. 
  The data are sent to the Android App by Bluetooh every 5 minutes, with real control of the vehicle.
